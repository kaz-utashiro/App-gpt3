# OpenAI API Command Line Wrapper

A simple command line interface for working with the GPT API.

## USAGE

gpty [options] prompts

## PROMPTS

Non-optional arguments are interpreted as GPT input prompts. If the argument is `-`, it is read from the standard input. Each prompt is concatenated with a newline character and sent to API.

## OPTIONS

### -s, --system *message*

Specifies a system message. Multiple messages can be specified by repeating.

### -I, --itemize *message*

Put the given message at the top of the prompt, and bullet other prompts by inserting `* ` at the top. The `-` is read from the standard input, but no bullet processing is performed on it. For example, you can use

    gpty -I 'Correct the following text according to the next conditions:' \
            'Lower case letters should be capitalized' \
            'Numbers should be Greek numerals' \
            - < data.txt

This is the same as instructing the user to: `-` `-`.

    gpty 'Correct the following text according to the next conditions:' \
         '* Lower case letters should be capitalized' \
         '* Numbers should be Greek numerals' \
         - < data.txt

It may not seem like much of a difference, but in Japanese, the prompt phrase does not include spaces, so it is easier to type from the command line without the need to use quotation marks.

### -e, --engine *name*

OpenAI GPT engine to use (default: gpt-3.5-turbo)

### -e, --engine *alias*

The following aliases are defined for the engine name: `-e3`, `-e4`, `-e5`, `-e6`, and `-e7`.

    3: gpt-3.5-turbo
	4: gpt-4

These can be used as `-e3`, `-e4`, and so on.

### -m, --max-tokens *number*

maximum number of tokens in response (default: 2000).

### -t, --temperature *number*

The `temperature` value (default: 0.5).

### -k, --key *string*

OpenAI API key.

### -q, --squeeze

combine two or more consecutive newline characters into one (default: false)

### -d, --debug

Display request and response contents in JSON format (default: False)

### -v, --version

Print version number and exit.

## NOTE

The OpenAI API key is set by the `--key` option or the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

## OTHER TOOS

### shell_gpt
  - https://github.com/TheR1D/shell_gpt
  - Can be used as a `sgtp` command
  - `-s` option is useful
  - It caches the results, which is useful for repeated runs
  - It is an excellent tool, and if you don't have trouble with it, you should definitely use it.
  - Can be difficult to use because the prompt cannot be given via stdin

### gpt3
  - https://github.com/CrazyPython/gpt3-cli
  - Simple shell script that calls curl

### gptee
  - https://github.com/zurawiki/gptee
  - cli tool written in RUST
  - I installed it, but it doesn't work with errors
  - At first I thought about naming it gptee, but when I looked for it, I found it, so I named it something else.
  - I installed the latest version on Nov. 2023 and it worked!
