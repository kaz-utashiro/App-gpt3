# OpenAI API Command Line Wrapper

A simple command line interface for working with the GPT API.

## USAGE

gpty [options] prompts

## PROMPTS

Non-optional arguments are interpreted as GPT input prompts. If the argument is `-`, it is read from the standard input. Each prompt is concatenated with a newline character and sent to API.

## OPTIONS

### -s, --system *message* Specifies a system message.

Specifies a system message. Multiple messages can be specified by repeating.

### -I, --itemize *message*

Put the given message at the top of the prompt, and bullet other prompts by inserting `* ` at the top. The `-` is read from standard input, but no bullet processing is performed on it. For example, you can use

gpty -I 'Correct the following text according to the next conditions:' \ 'Lower case letters should be capitalized' \ 'Numbers should be Greek numerals' - < data.txt

This is equivalent to the following instruction

gpty 'Correct the following text according to the next conditions:' \ '* Lower case letters should be capitalized' \ '* Numbers should be Greek numerals' \ - < data.txt

It may not seem like much of a difference, but in Japanese, the prompt phrase does not include spaces, so it is easier to type from the command line without the need to use quotation marks.

### -e, --engine *name*.

OpenAI GPT engine to use (default: gpt-3.5-turbo)

### -e, --engine *alias*

The following aliases are defined for the engine name: ### -e, --engine *alias

3: gpt-3.5-turbo 4: gpt-4

These can be used like `-e3` and `-e4`.

### -m, --max-tokens *number*.

Maximum number of tokens in response (default: 2000).

### -t, --temperature *number*

The `temperature` value (default: 0.5).

### -k, --key *string*

OpenAI API key.

### -q, --squeeze

combine two or more consecutive newline characters into one (default: false)

### -d, --debug

Display request and response contents in JSON format (default: False)

### -v, --version

Print version number and exit.

## NOTE

The OpenAI API key is set by the `--key` option or the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

## OTHER TOOS

### shell_gpt - https://github.com/TheR1D/shell_gpt - can be used as a `sgtp` command - `-s` option is useful - caches results so you can run it repeatedly - excellent tool, so if you don't have trouble with it, by all means Should be used - prompts cannot be given via stdin, so can be awkward to use

### gpt3 - https://github.com/CrazyPython/gpt3-cli - simple shell script that calls curl

### gptee - https://github.com/zurawiki/gptee - cli tool written in RUST - installed but didn't work with errors - first I thought it was called gptee but when I looked for it I found it so I called it something else - latest version in Nov 2023. I installed the latest version in November 2023 and it worked.

### llm - https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/ - https://github.com/simonw/llm - `llm prompt -s system-prompt < prompt-text` - I can use it like `llm prompt -s system-prompt < prompt-text` so this might work!
